🎯 **Project Scope Management**

# 🔹 What is Project Scope?

**Definition (PMBOK® Guide):**

> Project scope is the **work required** to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.

There are **two types of scope** you must understand clearly:

| Type              | Definition                                                                 | Example                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project Scope** | The **work** that needs to be completed to deliver the product or service. | Activities like designing, coding, testing, and deployment of a website. |
| **Product Scope** | The **features and functions** of the product, service, or result.         | The website will have a login page, shopping cart, and payment gateway.  |

📘 *In short:*

* **Project Scope** = *How you’ll do it.*
* **Product Scope** = *What you’ll deliver.*

---

# 🔹 Why Scope Management Matters

* Defines **boundaries** — what’s included and what’s not.
* Prevents **scope creep** (uncontrolled changes).
* Ensures **stakeholder expectations** are clearly understood and managed.
* Provides the **baseline** for cost, schedule, and performance tracking.

Let’s break down each one 👇

---

## 1️⃣ **Plan Scope Management**

**Purpose:**
Create a plan for how scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.

**Key Inputs:**

* Project Charter
* Project Management Plan
* Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)
* Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)

**Key Output:**

* **Scope Management Plan**
  (Defines how scope will be prepared, approved, and managed throughout the project.)

**Lesson:**
This plan sets the **rules and process** for managing scope.

---

## 2️⃣ **Collect Requirements**

**Purpose:**
Determine and document the stakeholder needs and expectations.

**Tools & Techniques:**

* Interviews
* Focus groups
* Workshops / JAD sessions
* Questionnaires & surveys
* Prototypes
* Brainstorming / mind mapping
* Observation (job shadowing)

**Key Outputs:**

* **Requirements documentation** (functional, non-functional, regulatory, business)
* **Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)**

📘 **RTM** links each requirement → business need → deliverable → test case
This ensures *no requirement is forgotten.*

---

## 3️⃣ **Define Scope**

**Purpose:**
Develop a detailed **project and product description**.

**Key Inputs:**

* Project Charter
* Requirements Documentation

**Key Output:**

* **Project Scope Statement**
  Contains:

  * Product scope description
  * Acceptance criteria
  * Deliverables
  * Exclusions
  * Constraints & assumptions

**Lesson:**
Scope statement is your *contract with stakeholders* — “This is what we will deliver.”

---

## 4️⃣ **Create WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**

**Purpose:**
Break the total scope into **manageable, measurable work packages.**

**Key Output:**

* **Scope Baseline**, which includes:

  * WBS
  * WBS Dictionary (details of each element)
  * Project Scope Statement

**What is WBS?**

> A hierarchical decomposition of total work into smaller components.

Example (for a Website Project):

```
1.0 Website Project
   1.1 Design
       1.1.1 UI/UX Design
       1.1.2 Logo & Branding
   1.2 Development
       1.2.1 Frontend
       1.2.2 Backend
   1.3 Testing
   1.4 Deployment
```

**Lesson:**
WBS ensures **nothing is missed** and helps with **estimating time, cost, and resources**.

---

## 5️⃣ **Validate Scope**

**Purpose:**
Get **formal acceptance** of completed deliverables from stakeholders or the customer.

**Tools & Techniques:**

* Inspections
* Reviews
* Demonstrations

**Key Outputs:**

* **Accepted deliverables**
* **Change requests** (if customer rejects or suggests changes)

**Lesson:**
Validate scope = **Customer sign-off**.
Control Quality ensures deliverables are correct; Validate Scope ensures they are *accepted.*

---

## 6️⃣ **Control Scope**

**Purpose:**
Monitor project and product scope and **manage changes** to the scope baseline.

**Key Outputs:**

* Work performance information
* Change requests

**Lesson:**
When stakeholders ask for new features, you evaluate the **impact** on schedule, cost, and quality before approval (via Change Control).

# 🔹 Key Terms to Know

| Term               | Meaning                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope Creep**    | Uncontrolled expansion of scope without change control.       |
| **Gold Plating**   | Adding extra features not requested — avoid this!             |
| **Scope Baseline** | Approved version of scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary. |
| **Work Package**   | Lowest level of WBS — where cost and time are estimated.      |
| **Deliverable**    | Any unique and verifiable product, service, or result.        |

---

# 🔹 Relationship Between Processes

```
Plan Scope Mgmt → Collect Requirements → Define Scope → Create WBS
                                          ↓
                                Scope Baseline → Validate Scope → Control Scope
```

---

# 🔹 PMP Exam Tips

✅ **1.** If the question involves defining what’s included/excluded → "Define Scope"
✅ **2.** If the question involves decomposing work → "Create WBS"
✅ **3.** If the question mentions stakeholder acceptance → "Validate Scope"
✅ **4.** If the question involves monitoring changes → "Control Scope"
✅ **5.** If uncontrolled changes are happening → “Perform Integrated Change Control” is required too

---

# 🔹 Real-World Example

**Scenario:**
You’re managing a Travel CRM development project.

* During sprint demo, client asks for a new "AI itinerary generator" feature.
* You analyze impact → It adds 3 weeks and $5,000.
* You log it as a **change request** → presented to the Change Control Board.
* If approved → update **scope baseline**.
* If rejected → communicate politely that it’s out of agreed scope.

# 🎯 **Project Scope Management (PMP Knowledge Area)**

## 🧭 **Purpose**

Scope Management ensures that the project **includes all the work required—and only the work required**—to deliver a successful product.
It clearly defines *what’s in scope* and *what’s out of scope.*

---

## 🔹 **Product Scope vs Project Scope**

| Type              | Definition                                                                    | Example (Game App Project)                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product Scope** | The *features and functions* of the product, service, or result.              | For a Teen Patti Game App: multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, in-app purchases, chat, animations. |
| **Project Scope** | The *work* that must be performed to deliver the product with those features. | Tasks such as UI design, server-side logic, API development, testing, and deployment.              |

📌 **In short:**

* *Product Scope* = What you will deliver.
* *Project Scope* = How you will deliver it.
