Absolutely 👍 this is one of the most **exam-favorite topics** in PMP!

In **Project Schedule Management**, **activity relationships (dependencies)** describe how activities are linked in the schedule. These are defined in **Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)**.

There are **four types of logical relationships**:

---

### 1️⃣ **Finish-to-Start (FS)** – *Most common*

* **Definition:** The successor cannot **start** until the predecessor **finishes**.
* **Example:** You cannot **start painting** (successor) until **wall construction is finished** (predecessor).

📌 Formula: *Finish A → Start B*

---

### 2️⃣ **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**

* **Definition:** The successor cannot **finish** until the predecessor **finishes**.
* **Example:** **Testing** (successor) cannot **finish** until **coding** (predecessor) finishes.
* Both activities may run in parallel but must finish in order.

📌 Formula: *Finish A → Finish B*

---

### 3️⃣ **Start-to-Start (SS)**

* **Definition:** The successor cannot **start** until the predecessor **starts**.
* **Example:** In construction, **pumping concrete** (predecessor) and **leveling concrete** (successor) must start together or with overlap.

📌 Formula: *Start A → Start B*

---

### 4️⃣ **Start-to-Finish (SF)** – *Least common*

* **Definition:** The successor cannot **finish** until the predecessor **starts**.
* **Example:** A **night security shift (successor)** cannot **finish** until the **day shift (predecessor)** starts.
* Rarely used in real projects.

📌 Formula: *Start A → Finish B*

### 🔑 Quick Memory Tip

* **FS** – Most common → “Task A must finish before Task B can start.”
* **FF** – Finish depends on Finish.
* **SS** – Start depends on Start.
* **SF** – Rare! Finish depends on Start.
