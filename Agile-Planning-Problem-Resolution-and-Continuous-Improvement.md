# 📘 **AGILE PLANNING, PROBLEM RESOLUTION & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

# ⭐ 1. **What is Adaptive Planning?**

Adaptive planning means **planning iteratively and updating the plan based on feedback**, not making a fixed, rigid plan at the beginning.

### Example

In a food delivery app project, if new competitor features appear, the next sprint plan can adapt and include similar features.

---

# ⭐ 2. **Agile Plans**

Agile plans exist at multiple levels:

* Product Vision
* Product Roadmap
* Release Plan
* Iteration (Sprint) Plan
* Daily Plan (Daily Scrum)

These plans evolve continuously.

---

# ⭐ 3. **Progressive Elaboration**

This means **refining requirements gradually** as more information becomes available.

### Example

Instead of designing entire app upfront, you detail only the next 1–2 sprints.

---

# ⭐ 4. **Value Decomposition & Product Box**

* **Value Decomposition:** Breaking big business value into smaller deliverables.
* **Product Box:** A workshop where stakeholders design a “box cover” showing product features like a real retail product.

### Example

Stakeholders draw a box for a travel booking app with:

* “Instant Booking”
* “Best Price Guarantee”
* “24x7 Support”

---

# ⭐ 5. **Coarse Requirements**

High-level, rough requirements that will be refined later.

### Example

“Add payment gateway integration” (high-level).

---

# ⭐ 6. **Timeboxing**

A fixed amount of time allocated for an activity.

Agile uses:

* 2-week sprints
* 15-minute standups
* 2-hour retrospectives

### Example

A spike to research a new API is timeboxed to 8 hours.

---

# ⭐ 7. **Estimation**

In Agile, estimation is:

* Relative (not exact)
* Collaboration-based
* Story points or t-shirt sizes

---

# ⭐ 8. **Ideal Time**

Ideal time = How long a task would take **if there were no interruptions**.

But because real work includes distractions → Agile prefers **story points**.

---

# ⭐ 9. **User Stories**

User stories capture requirements from the user's perspective.

**Format**:
*As a <user>, I want <feature>, so that <benefit>.*

### Example

As a traveler, I want to book a hotel so I can plan my trip easily.

---

# ⭐ 10. **User Story Backlog**

Product Backlog = **ordered list** of user stories.

Ordered by:

* Value
* Risk
* Priority
* Dependencies

---

# ⭐ 11. **Assign Points Using Fibonacci Sequence**

Story point values use:
**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…**

The gap increases because uncertainty increases.

---

# ⭐ 12. **Story Points and T-Shirt Sizing**

Two estimation methods:

### **Story Points**

Relative complexity (using numbers).

### **T-Shirt Sizes**

XS, S, M, L, XL — used for very early estimation.

---

# ⭐ 13. **Wideband Delphi**

Anonymous expert estimation technique.

Steps:

1. Experts estimate individually
2. Moderator collects estimates
3. Group discusses differences
4. Repeat until convergence

---

# ⭐ 14. **Planning Poker**

A gamified version of estimation.

Steps:

1. Product Owner explains user story
2. Each team member chooses a Fibonacci card
3. All reveal at same time
4. Discuss differences
5. Re-estimate until agreement

---

# ⭐ 15. **Story Maps & Product Roadmaps**

### **Story Map**

Horizontal = user journey
Vertical = priority

### **Product Roadmap**

High-level timeline of features, releases, milestones.

---

# ⭐ 16. **Iterations and Spikes**

* **Iteration:** Short development cycle (sprint).
* **Spike:** Timeboxed research activity.

### Example

Exploring a new Payment Gateway API → Spike.

---

# ⭐ 17. **Iteration & Release Planning**

* **Iteration Plan:** What will be done in the sprint
* **Release Plan:** What features will be delivered in a release (multiple sprints)

---

# ⭐ 18. **Understand How Problems Happen**

Problems arise due to:

* Miscommunication
* Process gaps
* Technical complexity
* Skill limitations
* Unclear requirements

Agile identifies problems early through:

* Standups
* Reviews
* Retrospectives

---

# ⭐ 19. **Technical Debt**

Shortcuts taken during development that must be repaid later.

### Example

Skipping unit testing to deliver fast → leads to bugs later.

---

# ⭐ 20. **Success & Failure Modes**

Success:

* Customer value delivered
* Working software
* Low defects
* Predictable velocity

Failure:

* Poor communication
* High technical debt
* Scope creep
* Unstable team

---

# ⭐ 21. **Lead Time & Cycle Time**

* **Lead Time:** When request is made → delivered
* **Cycle Time:** When work starts → delivered

Lower = better flow.

---

# ⭐ 22. **Defects**

Bugs found during testing or after release.

Agile targets:

* Defect prevention (TDD, CI/CD)
* Fast fixing
* Root cause analysis

---

# ⭐ 23. **Variances & Control Limits**

Variances = deviations from expected performance
Control limits = acceptable tolerance range

Agile teams track:

* Velocity
* Defect rates
* Cycle times

---

# ⭐ 24. **Risk Management**

In Agile:

* Risks are reviewed each iteration
* High-risks developed early
* Frequent releases reduce risk
* Burn-down charts help observe deviations

---

# ⭐ 25. **Fixing Problems**

Agile approach:

* Inspect and Adapt
* Daily Scrum fixes small issues
* Retrospective fixes larger patterns

---

# ⭐ 26. **Kaizen**

Japanese term = ** continuous improvement**.

Agile teams use Kaizen:

* Improve code quality
* Speed up delivery
* Reduce waste
* Automate processes

---

# ⭐ 27. **Customize Processes**

Every Agile team adapts practices:

* Modify sprint ceremonies
* Change WIP limits
* Adjust backlog refinement frequency

Process tailoring is allowed & encouraged.

---

# ⭐ 28. **Value Stream Mapping**

Visualizing the full workflow from request → delivery.

Used to find:

* Bottlenecks
* Delays
* Waste

---

# ⭐ 29. **Project Pre-Mortems**

Opposite of post-mortem.

Before project starts:

* Imagine the project failed
* Identify reasons
* Create preventive actions

---

# ⭐ 30. **Retrospective – Introduction**

Retrospective = meeting at end of each sprint to improve process.

---

# ⭐ 31. **Set the Stage**

Create safe environment:

* No blame
* Encourage open talk
* Define goals

---

# ⭐ 32. **Gather Data**

Collect facts:

* What went well
* What didn’t
* Data (velocity, bugs, cycle time)

---

# ⭐ 33. **Generate Insights**

Analyze why problems happened.

### Example

“Why was testing late?” → "Developers delivered too much on last day."

---

# ⭐ 34. **Decide What to Do**

Pick 1–3 actionable improvements:

* Automate tests
* Reduce WIP
* Refine backlog better

---

# ⭐ 35. **Close the Retrospective**

End with:

* Summary
* Thanks
* Celebration
* Follow-up actions

---

# ⭐ 36. **Team Self-Assessment**

Teams evaluate themselves on:

* Collaboration
* Technical excellence
* Communication
* Predictability
* Quality

Helps track team maturity.
