---

## 🔧 **Core Tools & Techniques for Project Planning**

### 1. 🗂️ **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

* **Purpose:** Breaks the project scope into smaller, manageable components.
* **Benefit:** Makes planning, assigning, and tracking easier.

---

### 2. 📊 **Gantt Chart**

* **Purpose:** Visual timeline of project tasks and milestones.
* **Benefit:** Shows task duration, dependencies, and overall project progress.
* **Tool Examples:** Microsoft Project, TeamGantt, Excel

---

### 3. ⏱️ **Critical Path Method (CPM)**

* **Purpose:** Identifies the **longest path** through the project with **zero float/slack**.
* **Benefit:** Highlights critical tasks that cannot be delayed without affecting the project deadline.

---

### 4. 🔁 **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**

* **Purpose:** Estimates task duration using three-point estimation:

  > **(Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6**
* **Benefit:** Helps manage **uncertainty in scheduling**.

---

### 5. 🧮 **Three-Point Estimating**

* **Purpose:** Improves estimation accuracy with three scenarios:
  ➤ Optimistic (O), Most Likely (M), Pessimistic (P)
* **Formula:**

  > **Expected Time (TE) = (O + 4M + P) ÷ 6**

---

### 6. 🧱 **Milestone Chart**

* **Purpose:** Shows major checkpoints or deliverables on a timeline.
* **Benefit:** Tracks project progress at a high level.

---

### 7. 📉 **Resource Histogram**

* **Purpose:** Visual representation of resource usage over time.
* **Benefit:** Helps balance workloads and avoid over-allocation.

---

### 8. ⚖️ **Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) / RACI Chart**

* **Purpose:** Clarifies **who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed** for each task.
* **Benefit:** Avoids confusion in roles and responsibilities.
