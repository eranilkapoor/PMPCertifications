# 📌 **1. Framework in PMP**

In PMP, **framework** means the **structure, methodology, and governance** used to manage a project. It tells us *how* the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled.

### **Framework Components:**

1. **Project Life Cycle** – Predictive, Agile, or Hybrid (Zerodha app → mostly Agile/Hybrid).
2. **Process Groups** – Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing.
3. **Knowledge Areas (10 in PMBOK)** – Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communication, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder, Integration.
4. **Governance Framework** – Who approves, who monitors progress, escalation matrix.
5. **Tools & Methodologies** – Agile (Scrum, Kanban), Waterfall, or hybrid mix.

✅ **Zerodha Example:**

* Trading Engine → Predictive (fixed requirements).
* Mobile App UI/UX → Agile (iterative sprints).
* Chatbot (AI/ML) → Hybrid (Agile for dev, Predictive for compliance).

---

# 📌 **2. Business Environment in PMP**

The **Business Environment** refers to the **external and internal factors** that influence project success. It aligns the **project goals** with the **organization’s strategy**.

### **Components:**

1. **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)**

   * External: Govt. regulations, market conditions, fintech compliance (SEBI in India), competitors like Zerodha/Groww.
   * Internal: Company culture, IT infrastructure, resource skills, tools.

2. **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**

   * Templates, lessons learned, historical data, policies, coding standards.

3. **Strategic Alignment**

   * Why the project exists → to capture stock trading market share & expand into fintech services.

4. **Business Case**

   * Justification: Profitability, cost reduction, new customer acquisition.

5. **Benefits Management Plan**

   * Tangible: Increased revenue from brokerage fees.
   * Intangible: Better brand reputation, customer trust.

* If exam asks: *“What should a PM consider first before starting a project?”* → Answer: **Business Environment (EEFs, OPAs, Business Case)**.

---

# 📌 **Plan and Manage Project Compliance**

## ✅ 1. Confirm project compliance requirements

* **What it means:** Identify **all mandatory requirements** your project must follow.
* **Sources:** Government regulations, industry standards, organizational policies, contracts.
* **Example:** For a trading app → SEBI & RBI regulations, GDPR for data privacy, PCI-DSS for payment security.

---

## ✅ 2. Classify compliance categories

* **Types of compliance:**

  1. **Regulatory** – Government & industry laws (SEBI, RBI, GDPR).
  2. **Contractual** – Client/vendor agreements.
  3. **Organizational** – Company internal policies.
  4. **Technical/Quality** – Coding standards, security compliance.
  5. **Health & Safety** – More relevant in construction/manufacturing.

* **Example:**

  * Regulatory → SEBI, GDPR.
  * Contractual → SLA with AWS cloud.
  * Organizational → Mphasis internal IT security.

---

## ✅ 3. Determine potential threats to compliance

* **What it means:** Identify risks that might cause noncompliance.
* **Examples:**

  * Developers not following secure coding → data breach.
  * Not updating app for new SEBI circular → penalties.
  * Vendor contract not reviewed → legal disputes.

---

## ✅ 4. Use methods to support compliance

* **Techniques:**

  * Checklists & audit reports.
  * Quality assurance reviews.
  * Automated security testing tools (SonarQube, OWASP, penetration testing).
  * Agile → compliance user stories.

* **Example:** In your trading app → add a **“Compliance Sprint”** for penetration testing, audit logs, and encryption.

---

## ✅ 5. Analyze the consequences of noncompliance

* **Risks include:**

  * **Financial:** Heavy penalties, fines.
  * **Legal:** Court cases, lawsuits.
  * **Reputational:** Loss of customer trust.
  * **Operational:** Service suspension.

* **Example:** Non-PCI compliance in payment gateway → fines & app banned from app stores.

---

## ✅ 6. Determine necessary approach and action

* **Options:**

  * Risk response (avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept).
  * Legal consultation.
  * Vendor compliance check.
  * Escalation to steering committee.

* **Example:**

  * If GDPR noncompliance risk → Mitigation = encryption + anonymization.
  * If SEBI rule changes → Adapt Agile sprint backlog to update trading features.

---

## ✅ 7. Measure extent of compliance

* **Tools:**

  * Compliance scorecards.
  * Internal & external audits.
  * KPI dashboards.
  * Continuous monitoring.

* **Example:** Monthly **compliance report** showing % of compliance tasks completed (e.g., 95% SEBI, 100% PCI, 90% AWS security).

⚡ **PMP Exam Tip:**
If the exam asks *“What should the project manager do FIRST when handling compliance?”* → Answer = **Identify & confirm compliance requirements**.

---

# 📌 **Evaluate and Deliver Project Benefits and Value**

## ✅ 1. Investigate that benefits are identified

* **What it means:** Make sure the project has **clearly defined business benefits** before execution.

* **Examples of benefits:**

  * Cost savings
  * Increased revenue
  * Improved customer satisfaction
  * Compliance with regulations

* **Example (Trading App):**

  * Benefit → Faster transactions = better user retention.
  * Benefit → 30% more customer acquisition through gamified referral system.

---

## ✅ 2. Document agreement on ownership for ongoing benefit realization

* **What it means:** Identify **who is responsible for tracking benefits after project closure**. (Often business units, not the project team).
* **Example (Travel CRM):**

  * Sales Team → Owns increased conversion rate tracking.
  * Marketing Team → Owns customer engagement metrics.
  * Operations Team → Owns cost reduction via automation.

---

## ✅ 3. Verify measurement system is in place to track benefits

* **What it means:** Ensure KPIs & metrics are defined and tools are ready.

* **Examples of systems:**

  * Dashboards (Power BI, Tableau).
  * Monthly reports.
  * OKRs (Objectives & Key Results).

* **Example:**

  * KPI → Customer satisfaction score ≥ 90%.
  * KPI → Reduce support call handling time from 5 min to 2 min.

---

## ✅ 4. Evaluate delivery options to demonstrate value

* **What it means:** Assess which delivery method (Predictive, Agile, Hybrid) provides **best value in given constraints**.
* **Example:**

  * **Agile:** Best for fast-changing fintech compliance rules.
  * **Predictive:** Best for construction project with fixed specs.
  * **Hybrid:** CRM project → Predictive for database setup, Agile for UI features.

---

## ✅ 5. Appraise stakeholders of value gain progress

* **What it means:** Keep stakeholders updated on how much benefit/value is being delivered (not just project outputs).

* **Tools:**

  * Benefit realization reports.
  * Value dashboards.
  * Sprint reviews (for Agile).

* **Example (Trading App):**

  * Report: “Referral program increased active users by 25% in Q1.”
  * Report: “Payment automation saved ₹30L/year in manual processing costs.”

---

⚡ **PMP Exam Tip:**

* Project managers deliver **outputs** (products, services).
* **Business value and benefits** are realized **after project handover**, owned by **business stakeholders**.
* If asked *“Who owns benefit realization?”* → Answer = **Business/Operations, not the PM**.

---

# 📌 **Evaluate and Address External Business Environment Changes for Impact on Scope**

## ✅ 1. Survey changes to external business environment

* **Meaning:** Continuously monitor the **outside world** for factors that could affect the project.

* **Possible factors:**

  * **Regulations:** New data privacy laws (GDPR, RBI guidelines).
  * **Technology:** AI/ML advancements, new cloud services.
  * **Geopolitical:** Trade restrictions, war, sanctions.
  * **Market:** Customer demand shifts, competitor launches.

* **Example (Banking Chatbot Project):**

  * RBI releases **new KYC compliance rules** → chatbot must include new verification features.

---

## ✅ 2. Assess and prioritize impact on project scope/backlog

* **Meaning:** Evaluate **how much the change affects project scope** (features, requirements, priorities).

* **Impact Areas:**

  * Cost
  * Schedule
  * Quality
  * Resources

* **Example (E-Commerce Platform):**

  * New EU law requires **cookie consent banner** → scope update is high priority, must deliver before go-live.

---

## ✅ 3. Recommend options for scope/backlog changes

* **Meaning:** Provide choices to stakeholders on **how to respond**.

* **Options:**

  * Adjust schedule (delay to include changes).
  * Adjust cost (add budget to hire more devs).
  * Adjust scope (drop low-priority features to fit compliance).

* **Example (Travel CRM):**

  * Change: Airline introduces **new booking API**.
  * Options:

    * Integrate new API (extra 2 weeks).
    * Delay integration to later release.
    * Drop other low-value features to free bandwidth.

---

## ✅ 4. Continually review external business environment

* **Meaning:** This isn’t a **one-time check** — PM must continuously monitor environment throughout the project.

* **Tools/Methods:**

  * Risk register updates.
  * Regulatory watch.
  * Market analysis reports.
  * Agile backlog refinement meetings.

* **Example (Gaming Platform):**

  * Govt. announces **ban on real-money games in some states** → scope must adapt (disable money play in restricted regions).

| Step              | Meaning                            | Example                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Survey changes    | Monitor laws, tech, markets        | RBI KYC rule, GDPR               |
| Assess impact     | Identify effect on scope/backlog   | Add cookie banner                |
| Recommend options | Give alternatives for scope change | Delay, add budget, drop features |
| Continual review  | Keep tracking environment          | Gaming ban → restrict play       |

---

# ⚡ PMP Exam Tip:

* External business environment changes are **enterprise environmental factors (EEF)**.
* Always link to **scope, schedule, and cost impacts**.
* In **Agile projects**, backlog refinement sessions are the best place to adapt scope quickly.
* PM should **recommend** → sponsor & stakeholders **decide**.

---

# 📌 **Support Organizational Change**

Projects don’t happen in isolation — they exist inside organizations that have their own **culture, structure, and processes**. As a project manager, you must help **adapt the project to organizational change** and also help the **organization adapt to project-driven change**.

---

## ✅ 1. Assess organizational culture

* **Meaning:** Understand how the organization operates, its values, and readiness for change.

* **Culture Types:**

  * Hierarchical (strict processes, approvals).
  * Agile/Innovative (open to experimentation).
  * Risk-averse (slow in adopting change).
  * Customer-centric (decisions based on client needs).

* **Example:**

  * In a **government IT project**, the culture may be **bureaucratic** → expect long approval cycles.
  * In a **startup gaming project**, culture is **innovative and agile** → open to quick changes.

---

## ✅ 2. Evaluate impact of organizational change on the project

* **Meaning:** Check if organizational changes (restructuring, leadership shifts, mergers, new policies) affect your project.

* **Possible Impacts:**

  * New leadership → change in project priorities.
  * Merger → duplication of systems → need to integrate.
  * New compliance rule → scope/schedule changes.

* **Required Actions:**

  * Update project charter or scope.
  * Re-plan resources and budget.
  * Communicate impact to stakeholders.

* **Example:**

  * Your project is delivering a **CRM system**, but the company merges with another → new workflows must be added to scope.

---

## ✅ 3. Evaluate impact of the project on the organization

* **Meaning:** Check how your project itself will **change the organization** (processes, people, systems).

* **Impact Areas:**

  * Roles & responsibilities.
  * Skills/training needs.
  * Process change adoption.
  * Cultural shift.

* **Required Actions:**

  * Conduct **Change Impact Analysis**.
  * Provide training & support.
  * Prepare a transition plan.
  * Engage change champions.

* **Example:**

  * You deliver a **Kore.Ai chatbot** for customer support → agents now handle only complex queries.

    * Action: Train agents for advanced issue handling + update job descriptions.
