‚úÖ I can generate these as a **ZIP pack of DOCX/PDF templates** so you can edit & share with your team.

üëâ Do you want me to **generate the first set (BRD + SRS + Architecture + ERD)** in Word/PDF format right now, and then I‚Äôll continue with the remaining?


============================================================================================================
Awesome ‚Äî I‚Äôve generated a complete **API spec (OpenAPI 3.0)** and a **MySQL 8 DB schema** covering **all phases/modules** for your Travel CRM.

**Download your docs:**

* [OpenAPI Spec (YAML)](sandbox:/mnt/data/openapi.yaml)
* [MySQL Schema (SQL)](sandbox:/mnt/data/schema.sql)
* [README (Phase map & setup)](sandbox:/mnt/data/README.md)

### What‚Äôs inside

* **Modules & phases:** Auth, Users, Roles, Partners, Leads, Customers, Vendors, Destinations, Hotels, Activities, Itineraries, Bookings, Invoices, Payments (+ Webhooks), Offers, Files (S3-style), Notifications, Integrations, Reports, Settings, Audit Logs.
* **API design:** JWT bearer auth, tenant scoping via `partnerId`, pagination (`page`, `limit`), search (`q`), sample request/response shapes, webhook endpoint for payments.
* **DB design:** UUIDs as `CHAR(36)`, proper FKs & indexes, GST fields on invoices, JSON columns where flexible (tags, permissions, credentials), audit log table.

If you want, I can:

* Split the OpenAPI spec by **phase** or **module**,
* Generate a **Postman collection** and **example JSONs**,
* Add **role/permission** matrices and **scope-based** security to each endpoint,
* Provide **seed SQL** (sample data for partners, roles, etc.).

Tell me your preferred **payment gateway(s)** (Razorpay/Stripe/etc.) and I‚Äôll drop in provider-specific fields & webhook payload examples.

================================================================================================================
Perfect üëç since you want **Razorpay** integration in your **Travel CRM**, I‚Äôll extend the API + DB design to support it.

---

# üîë Razorpay Integration in Travel CRM

## 1. **DB Schema Additions**

Update the `payments` table (already created) to store Razorpay fields:

```sql
ALTER TABLE payments 
ADD COLUMN provider ENUM('razorpay','stripe','paypal') DEFAULT 'razorpay',
ADD COLUMN provider_order_id VARCHAR(255),  -- Razorpay order_id
ADD COLUMN provider_payment_id VARCHAR(255), -- Razorpay payment_id
ADD COLUMN provider_signature VARCHAR(255);  -- Signature for verification
```

Optional: Create a `payment_webhooks` table to log Razorpay webhook calls:

```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_webhooks (
    id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    payment_id CHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    event_name VARCHAR(100),
    payload JSON,
    received_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (payment_id) REFERENCES payments(id)
);
```

---

## 2. **API Flow**

### Step 1: Create Order (Backend ‚Üí Razorpay API)

```http
POST /payments/order
```

**Request**

```json
{
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "INR",
  "receipt": "INV-1001",
  "notes": { "bookingId": "B1234" }
}
```

**Backend Action**

* Call Razorpay `orders.create()` with amount in paise.
* Save `provider_order_id` in DB.

**Response**

```json
{
  "orderId": "order_9A33XWu170gUtm",
  "currency": "INR",
  "amount": 5000,
  "key": "rzp_test_xxxx"
}
```

---

### Step 2: Client-side Payment

* Use **Razorpay Checkout.js / SDK** in frontend.
* Collect payment ‚Üí sends `razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_order_id`, and `razorpay_signature` back to backend.

---

### Step 3: Verify Payment (Backend)

```http
POST /payments/verify
```

**Request**

```json
{
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_9A33XWu170gUtm",
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f",
  "razorpay_signature": "generated_signature"
}
```

**Backend Action**

* Validate signature using HMAC SHA256 with `key_secret`.
* If valid ‚Üí mark payment as `completed` in DB.

**Response**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "paymentId": "pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f"
}
```

---

### Step 4: Webhook (Optional, for Reliability)

```http
POST /webhooks/razorpay
```

**Sample Webhook Payload**

```json
{
  "event": "payment.captured",
  "payload": {
    "payment": {
      "entity": {
        "id": "pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f",
        "order_id": "order_9A33XWu170gUtm",
        "amount": 5000,
        "currency": "INR",
        "status": "captured",
        "method": "card",
        "email": "customer@test.com",
        "contact": "9876543210"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Backend Action**

* Verify webhook signature (`X-Razorpay-Signature`).
* Log into `payment_webhooks` table.
* Update `payments.status`.

---

## 3. **Security**

* Store `key_id` and `key_secret` in **encrypted env vars / AWS Secrets Manager**.
* Always **verify both client-side and server-side** to avoid tampering.
* Enforce **HTTPS** for webhook endpoint.

---

‚úÖ Next Step:
I can **update your OpenAPI spec + schema.sql** to include Razorpay fields, endpoints (`/payments/order`, `/payments/verify`, `/webhooks/razorpay`) and re-export them.

üëâ Do you want me to generate the **updated OpenAPI & SQL files with Razorpay integration** now?

===================================================================================================
Done ‚Äî I added **Razorpay** to your API & DB design and generated the updated files.

**Download links**

* OpenAPI spec (with Razorpay endpoints): sandbox:/mnt/data/openapi-razorpay.yaml
* SQL schema additions (payments + webhooks): sandbox:/mnt/data/schema-razorpay.sql
* README with implementation notes: sandbox:/mnt/data/README-razorpay.md

### What's included (quick summary)

* `/payments/order` ‚Äî Create Razorpay order (backend) and persist `provider_order_id`.
* `/payments/verify` ‚Äî Verify client-returned signature (`razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_signature`) and mark payment success.
* `/webhooks/razorpay` ‚Äî Webhook endpoint; verify `X-Razorpay-Signature`, log payloads to `payment_webhooks`, update statuses.
* `payments` table extended with `provider_order_id`, `provider_payment_id`, `provider_signature`, `provider_response`.
* `payment_webhooks` table for storing raw webhook events and headers.

Would you like me to now:

1. Generate **Node.js (Express)** sample code for:

   * Creating Razorpay order (server-side),
   * Verifying signature on `/payments/verify`,
   * Webhook handler with signature verification and idempotency; or
2. Create a **Postman collection** with example requests and sample webhook payloads?

Pick one and I‚Äôll produce it right away.
