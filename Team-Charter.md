Great one 👍 — **Team Charter** is another PMP favorite. Let’s break it down clearly.

---

# **Team Charter (in PMP / PMBOK® Guide)**

### ✅ **Definition**

A **Team Charter** is a **document that establishes the team’s values, agreements, and guidelines** on how the team will operate, collaborate, and make decisions.

It’s like a **rulebook + agreement** created *with the team members* to ensure alignment and smooth functioning.

---

### 🔑 **Contents of a Team Charter**

Typically, it includes:

1. **Team Values & Principles** – Respect, trust, transparency, accountability.
2. **Team Roles & Responsibilities** – Who does what, clear boundaries.
3. **Decision-Making Process** – Consensus, voting, or PM’s call.
4. **Conflict Resolution Approach** – How conflicts will be raised and resolved.
5. **Communication Guidelines** – Meeting frequency, tools (e.g., Slack, MS Teams).
6. **Meeting Etiquette** – Punctuality, participation, action items.
7. **Ground Rules** – Working hours, availability, email/response times.
8. **Performance Expectations** – Quality standards, deadlines, accountability.
9. **Escalation Process** – What to do when issues can’t be solved at the team level.

### 🔎 **Why Important?**

* Builds **team alignment** early.
* Reduces misunderstandings.
* Creates **buy-in** since rules are co-created.
* Improves **team performance and accountability**.

* It’s created **early in the project** (often in project initiation or early planning).
* Helps in **team building, collaboration, and conflict resolution**.
