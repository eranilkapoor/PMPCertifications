## **Project Calendar (in PMP / PMBOK® Guide)**

A **Project Calendar** is a calendar that defines the **working days, non-working days, and shifts** for the **entire project**.
It tells you **when project work can take place**.

### 🔑 **Key Points**

* Defines **working days** (e.g., Monday–Friday, 9 AM–6 PM).
* Defines **non-working days** (e.g., weekends, public holidays, planned shutdowns).
* Can include **special shifts** (e.g., night shift, 24x7 work, overtime rules).
* Used to determine **when activities can be scheduled** on the project timeline.
* Different from **Resource Calendar**, which applies to specific people or resources.

---

### 📌 **Example**

* **Project Calendar:**

  * Working days: Mon–Sat, 9 AM–6 PM
  * Non-working: Sundays, National Holidays

* **Resource Calendar (for a specific person):**

  * John: Available only Mon–Fri, 10 AM–4 PM
  * Crane machine: Available only at night shift

So, the **project calendar** defines the **default working time for the entire project**, while **resource calendars** are exceptions for specific people/resources.

### ✅ **Exam Tip (PMP)**

* **Project Calendar** = governs **when project work happens**.
* **Resource Calendar** = governs **when individual resources are available**.
* Tools like **MS Project** or **Primavera** use project calendars to schedule tasks properly.
