# **Tuckmanâ€™s Ladder of Team Development**

Bruce Tuckman (1965) proposed that teams evolve through **stages of development** before becoming high-performing.
In **PMP**, this model is used to understand how project teams grow and improve.

### ðŸ”‘ **Stages of Tuckmanâ€™s Ladder**

1. **Forming** ðŸŸ¢

   * Team comes together for the first time.
   * Members are polite, unsure of their roles, and look to the PM for guidance.
   * **PMâ€™s role:** Provide direction, establish ground rules, and create clarity.

2. **Storming** ðŸ”´

   * Conflicts arise over roles, responsibilities, or ways of working.
   * Team members challenge each other and the PM.
   * **PMâ€™s role:** Manage conflicts, encourage open communication, and build trust.

3. **Norming** ðŸŸ¡

   * Team starts resolving differences, establishing norms, and building collaboration.
   * Members begin to trust each other and align on goals.
   * **PMâ€™s role:** Facilitate cooperation, reinforce positive behavior, empower the team.

4. **Performing** ðŸŸ¢

   * Team reaches high productivity and autonomy.
   * Members collaborate smoothly with minimal conflict.
   * **PMâ€™s role:** Focus on delegation, strategic leadership, and stakeholder management.

5. **Adjourning** (sometimes called **Mourning**) âšª

   * Project is completed, and the team disbands.
   * Emotional phase â€” members may feel loss after strong collaboration.
   * **PMâ€™s role:** Celebrate success, release resources, conduct lessons learned.

### ðŸ“Œ **Example (Software Project Team)**

* **Forming:** Team introduced, requirements discussed.
* **Storming:** Developers argue about coding standards, testers push for more time.
* **Norming:** Team agrees on Git workflow and testing process.
* **Performing:** Team delivers features smoothly in each sprint.
* **Adjourning:** Final release delivered, team moves to new projects.

### âœ… **Exam Tip (PMP)**

* **Storming = conflicts** (most effort from PM here).
* **Performing = high productivity** (least effort from PM here).
* Teams **donâ€™t skip stages** â†’ they must progress step by step.
