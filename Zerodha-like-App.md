That’s a great initiative 🚀—building a **stock market app like Zerodha** is a large-scale project, and if you want to manage it strictly following **PMP (Project Management Professional)** practices, you’ll need to go step by step through the **project lifecycle**, preparing the right documents, and ensuring governance is in place.

I’ll guide you **end-to-end** using **Zerodha-like stock market app** as the case study.

# 🔹 PMP-Based End-to-End Guide for a Stock Market App Project

The **PMBOK (PMP)** approach follows **5 Process Groups** across **10 Knowledge Areas**. I’ll map them with your project.

---

## 📍 1. **Initiating Process Group**

Here you define the **vision, business case, and high-level scope**.

### Key Activities

* Identify stakeholders (investors, traders, regulators, developers, testers, compliance, brokers, RBI/SEBI).
* Develop a **Business Case**:

  * Why: India’s stock trading market is growing rapidly (case study Zerodha).
  * Benefit: Commission-free trades, gamified UI, digital onboarding.
  * ROI: Revenue via brokerage, premium plans, mutual funds.
* Write a **Project Charter**:

  * Objective: Build a scalable, SEBI-compliant stock trading app like Zerodha.
  * High-Level Scope: Mobile app + Web trading + APIs + KYC onboarding + Market data integration.
  * Constraints: Regulatory approvals, budget, technology stack.
  * Assumptions: SEBI approval will be obtained, users adopt digital KYC.
* Identify Sponsor & PM authority.
