# 🔹 What is a Project Management Lifecycle?

The **Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC)** describes the **phases a project goes through** from initiation to closure. It provides a **structured framework** to manage work, resources, risks, and deliverables.

Different projects require different lifecycles depending on:

* **Level of uncertainty** (requirements clear or evolving?)
* **Level of stakeholder involvement**
* **Risk tolerance**
* **Need for flexibility vs. control**

# 🔹 Types of Project Management Lifecycles

## 1. **Predictive (Waterfall) Lifecycle**

* **Characteristics:**

  * Requirements are **clear and fixed** from the start.
  * Project is planned upfront → **scope, cost, and schedule baselined early**.
  * Each phase must be completed before moving to the next (sequential).

* **Best for:** Construction, manufacturing, regulated industries.

* **Example Flow:**
  Initiation → Planning → Execution → Monitoring & Controlling → Closing.

---

## 2. **Iterative Lifecycle**

* **Characteristics:**

  * Product is developed through **repeated cycles (iterations)**.
  * Each iteration delivers **improvements or partial deliverables**.
  * Requirements may evolve after feedback from earlier iterations.

* **Best for:** Complex projects where the **solution is not fully defined upfront**.

* **Example:** Developing a prototype of a medical device → refine with each iteration until final approval.

---

## 3. **Incremental Lifecycle**

* **Characteristics:**

  * Deliverables are built in **increments (chunks of functionality)**.
  * Each increment is **usable on its own**.
  * Final product = sum of increments.

* **Best for:** Software releases, phased rollouts.

* **Example:** Banking app → release login + balance check first, then funds transfer, then bill payments.

---

## 4. **Adaptive (Agile) Lifecycle**

* **Characteristics:**

  * Requirements are **emergent and evolving**.
  * Work is performed in **short cycles (sprints/iterations)**.
  * Strong **stakeholder collaboration** and **continuous feedback**.
  * Scope is flexible; cost and schedule are fixed (time-boxed).

* **Best for:** High-uncertainty projects, fast-changing markets, digital/software projects.

* **Examples:** Scrum, Kanban, Lean, XP.

---

## 5. **Hybrid Lifecycle**

* **Characteristics:**

  * Combines **predictive** and **adaptive** approaches.
  * Predictive for stable parts (e.g., compliance, infrastructure).
  * Adaptive for uncertain parts (e.g., UI/UX design, innovation).

* **Best for:** Large, complex projects where **some elements are stable and others uncertain**.

* **Example:** Pharma project → drug formulation (predictive) + patient engagement app (Agile).

# 🔹 Lifecycle vs. Process Groups (PMP Exam Trap 🚨)

* **Lifecycle = Phases of project development** (predictive, adaptive, hybrid).
* **Process Groups = PMI’s 5 groups** (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring/Controlling, Closing).
  👉 Process groups can occur within **any lifecycle**.

# 🔹 Visual Summary

| Lifecycle        | Scope       | Cost & Schedule   | Flexibility | Example Project     |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Predictive       | Fixed       | Fixed             | Low         | Bridge construction |
| Iterative        | Evolving    | May vary          | Medium      | Prototype design    |
| Incremental      | Progressive | Controlled        | Medium      | Software rollout    |
| Adaptive (Agile) | Flexible    | Fixed time & cost | High        | Mobile app dev      |
| Hybrid           | Mixed       | Mixed             | Balanced    | Pharma + app        |

✅ **Key Lesson for PMP:**

* Use **Predictive** when requirements are well known.
* Use **Adaptive/Agile** when requirements are uncertain.
* Use **Hybrid** when some parts are predictable and others need flexibility.
