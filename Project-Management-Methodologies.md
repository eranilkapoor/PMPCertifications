Project management methodologies are structured approaches used to plan, execute, and control projects efficiently. Each methodology offers different processes, tools, and techniques tailored to specific project needs.

Here's a concise overview of the **most common project management methodologies**:

---

### üîπ 1. **Waterfall**

* **Type:** Sequential, linear process
* **Best For:** Well-defined projects with fixed scope and requirements
* **Phases:** Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance
* **Pros:** Easy to manage, well-documented
* **Cons:** Inflexible to changes, late testing phase

---

### üîπ 2. **Agile**

* **Type:** Iterative and incremental
* **Best For:** Projects with evolving requirements (e.g., software development)
* **Frameworks:** Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP)
* **Pros:** Adaptive, customer-focused, promotes collaboration
* **Cons:** Requires high team involvement and discipline

---

### üîπ 3. **Scrum** (A subset of Agile)

* **Type:** Agile framework with fixed-length iterations (sprints)
* **Best For:** Small, cross-functional teams
* **Key Roles:** Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team
* **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Burndown Chart

---

### üîπ 4. **Kanban**

* **Type:** Visual workflow management
* **Best For:** Continuous delivery environments
* **Tools:** Kanban board, Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits
* **Pros:** Simple, flexible, encourages gradual improvement

---

### üîπ 5. **Lean**

* **Focus:** Eliminating waste, improving efficiency
* **Best For:** Manufacturing and startups
* **Principles:** Value stream mapping, continuous improvement, just-in-time delivery

---

### üîπ 6. **Six Sigma**

* **Type:** Data-driven, quality-focused
* **Best For:** Improving processes and reducing defects
* **Methodologies:** DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), DMADV

---

### üîπ 7. **PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments)**

* **Type:** Structured, process-based
* **Best For:** Government and large enterprise projects (especially in the UK)
* **Principles:** Defined roles, business justification, focus on products
* **Phases:** Starting up, Initiating, Directing, Managing stages

---

### üîπ 8. **Critical Path Method (CPM)**

* **Type:** Schedule-driven
* **Best For:** Projects with complex dependencies
* **Focus:** Identifying the longest path of planned activities to the end
* **Pros:** Helps identify bottlenecks and optimize timelines

---

### üîπ 9. **Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)**

* **Type:** Time and resource-focused
* **Best For:** Projects with resource constraints
* **Focus:** Buffer management, resource leveling, eliminating multitasking

---

### üîπ 10. **Hybrid (Waterfall + Agile)**

* **Type:** Combination approach
* **Best For:** Projects that need structured planning but flexible execution
* **Example:** Planning with Waterfall, development with Agile
