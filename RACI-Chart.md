Perfect question 👍 — this one is **very important for PMP** and often comes in situational questions.

# **RACI Chart in PMP**

### ✅ **Definition**

The **RACI Chart** (also called a **Responsibility Assignment Matrix – RAM**) is a tool used in **Project Resource Management** to clearly define **roles and responsibilities** for project tasks and deliverables.

It prevents confusion by showing **who is responsible for what**.

---

### 🔑 **RACI Stands For:**

* **R – Responsible**

  * Person(s) who actually **do the work**.
  * "The Doer."
* **A – Accountable**

  * The **owner of the task/deliverable**, ultimately answerable.
  * Approves/signs off the work.
  * Only **one person** should be “A” for each task.
* **C – Consulted**

  * People who provide **input, expertise, or advice**.
  * Two-way communication.
* **I – Informed**

  * People who need to be kept **updated** on progress/decisions.
  * One-way communication.

### 📌 **Example RACI Chart**

| Task / Deliverable  | Project Manager | Developer | QA Tester | Client |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------- | --------- | ------ |
| Define Requirements | A               | R         | C         | I      |
| Develop Code        | C               | R         | I         | I      |
| Test Code           | I               | C         | R         | I      |
| Approve Deliverable | A               | I         | I         | R      |

### 🔎 **Key Benefits**

* Removes confusion (“Who’s doing this?”).
* Ensures accountability is clear.
* Improves communication by showing who needs to be involved.
* Prevents duplication of effort.

---

### ✅ **Exam Tip**

* **Only one “A” per task** → accountability cannot be shared.
* "R" can be multiple, but too many Rs cause inefficiency.
* RACI is often tested with situational questions like: *“Who should sign off the deliverable?” → The one marked as **A (Accountable)**.*

👉 Would you like me to also create a **visual diagram (matrix chart)** of a RACI for one project scenario (like software development or construction) so you can **remember it faster**?
