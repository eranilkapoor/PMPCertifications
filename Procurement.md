* Multiple vendors bid; you **evaluate proposals** using weighted scoring.
* You select the **best value vendor** and sign a **fixed-price contract**.
* During execution, you **monitor performance** and process **payments** after inspection.
* Finally, you **close procurement** once the work is accepted and documented.

## 🧭 **Procurement Management Plan**

A component of the Project Management Plan that defines:

* Types of contracts to be used
* Risk management for procurements
* Roles and responsibilities
* Approval processes
* Templates and legal requirements
* How to manage contract changes
* How to close procurements

✅ **Example (Game Project)**
“Server hosting contracts will be fixed-price annual agreements with AWS. Payment gateway integrations will use cost-reimbursable contracts due to variable transaction volumes.”

---

## ⚙️ **Procurement Strategy**

Defines *how* procurement will be conducted:

* **Delivery method:** e.g., turnkey, design–build, subcontracting
* **Contract type:** fixed price, T&M, or cost reimbursable
* **Procurement phases:** single vendor or multi-vendor approach
* **Procurement schedule:** timeline of when each contract will be awarded

✅ Example: “UI assets will be outsourced through a fixed-price contract; backend server maintenance will be a time & material contract.”

---

## 📜 **Types of Agreements**

1. **Buyer–Seller Contract** – Between your company and an external vendor.
2. **Inter-organization Agreement** – Between departments of the same organization.
3. **Verbal Agreement** – Rarely recommended unless legally binding under local law.
4. **Written Contract** – Always preferred; must be legally enforceable.

---

## 🤝 **Agile Contracts**

In Agile or hybrid projects:

* Contracts must **allow flexibility** for changing requirements.
* Focus on **collaboration over strict scope**.
* Common types:

  * **Time & Materials with not-to-exceed limit**
  * **Incremental Delivery Contracts**
  * **Joint Ventures / Shared Risk–Reward**
  * **Agile Master Service Agreements (MSAs)**

✅ Example:
“Vendor will deliver game modules every 2 sprints; payments are milestone-based after product owner acceptance.”

---

## 💰 **Contract Types**

There are **three main families**:

---

### 1️⃣ **Fixed-Price (Lump Sum)**

**Definition:** Buyer pays a set price for a defined product or service.

**Subtypes:**

* **Firm Fixed Price (FFP)** – Price doesn’t change.
* **Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)** – Bonus/penalty based on performance.
* **Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FP-EPA)** – Allows for inflation or cost changes.

✅ *Example:* Hire a studio to build a full Teen Patti app for ₹10 lakh.

---

### 2️⃣ **Time and Material (T&M)**

**Definition:** Hybrid between fixed and cost-based — pay for time and resources used.
Useful for **flexible scope** projects.

✅ *Example:* Hire a UI designer at ₹2000/hour for ongoing design updates.

---

### 3️⃣ **Cost-Reimbursable**

**Definition:** Buyer reimburses all costs plus an agreed fee.
**Subtypes:**

* **Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)** – Fixed fee regardless of cost.
* **Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)** – Fee tied to performance.
* **Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)** – Fee based on subjective satisfaction.

✅ *Example:* Hire an AI development vendor to create new algorithms where costs are uncertain.

---

## ⚖️ **Advantages / Disadvantages**

| Contract Type         | Advantages                                  | Disadvantages                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Price**       | Predictable budget; low buyer risk          | High seller risk; scope changes expensive |
| **T&M**               | Flexible scope; quick start                 | Cost control risk for buyer               |
| **Cost-Reimbursable** | Encourages innovation; detailed audit trail | Budget uncertainty; high buyer risk       |

---

## ✍️ **Customized Contracts**

Contracts can be **tailored** by combining clauses:

* Fixed Price + Incentive clauses
* T&M + Cost ceilings
* Hybrid Agile contracts with rolling wave milestones

✅ Example: “Vendor will deliver one module per sprint (T&M) with ₹50,000 bonus if overall timeline met.”

---

## 🔄 **Contract Change Control System**

Defines how contract modifications are:

* **Proposed**
* **Reviewed**
* **Approved or rejected**
* **Documented**

✅ Example: If the game design scope changes, vendor raises a change request; PM and procurement officer approve via a formal Change Control Board.

---

## ❌ **Termination**

A contract can end by:

* **Performance** – Work completed
* **Mutual agreement** – Both parties agree
* **Default** – One party breaches
* **Convenience** – Buyer terminates without cause (with compensation)

---

## 📂 **Bid Documents**

Used to invite vendor proposals:

* **RFI (Request for Information)** – To gather info
* **RFP (Request for Proposal)** – To request solution proposals
* **RFQ (Request for Quotation)** – To request prices only

✅ Example: Send an RFP for multiplayer backend service provider.

---

## ⚙️ **Make-or-Buy Analysis**

Decides whether to **build in-house or outsource**.

| Criteria  | Considerations             |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Cost      | Is outsourcing cheaper?    |
| Expertise | Do we have in-house skill? |
| Time      | Is outsourcing faster?     |
| Risk      | Are vendors reliable?      |

✅ Example: Build your own matchmaking algorithm vs buy a 3rd-party SDK.

---

## 🧮 **Source Selection Criteria**

Defines how vendors are evaluated:

* Technical expertise
* Cost proposal
* Experience
* Past performance
* Quality certifications
* Schedule capability

✅ Usually captured in a **weighted scoring system**.

---

## 🔒 **Noncompetitive Procurement**

Used when competition isn’t feasible:

* **Single Source:** Chosen vendor due to past success.
* **Sole Source:** Only one vendor exists.
* **Emergency Purchase:** Urgent situation.

---

## 📑 **Types of Procurement SOW (Statement of Work)**

| Type                  | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance SOW**   | Defines what result is needed.                     |
| **Functional SOW**    | Defines function or purpose.                       |
| **Design/Detail SOW** | Specifies exact materials, methods, and processes. |

✅ Example:

* Performance: “App must handle 10,000 concurrent users.”
* Design: “Use Node.js backend with MongoDB.”

---

## 🧱 **Fixed Price Work Packages**

In large projects, divide contracts into smaller **fixed-scope modules** for better control.

✅ Example: “Teen Patti game logic module – ₹1,00,000; Payment gateway – ₹50,000.”

---

## 🏁 **Closed Procurements**

Formal completion:

* Verify deliverables
* Settle claims
* Update lessons learned
* Archive documents

---

## 🗣️ **Bidder Conferences**

Meetings with potential vendors to clarify requirements **before** submission of bids — ensures all bidders get identical info.

---

## 🧾 **Proposal Evaluation**

Using scoring criteria to assess vendor proposals:

* Weighting system (e.g., 40% cost, 30% experience, 30% quality)
* Independent evaluation panel
* Negotiation phase follows

---

## ⚠️ **Risk and Contract Type**

| Contract          | Risk for Buyer | Risk for Seller |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Fixed Price       | Low            | High            |
| Cost Reimbursable | High           | Low             |
| T&M               | Moderate       | Moderate        |

---

## 🔍 **Make-or-Buy Decisions**

Should be re-evaluated periodically — what made sense in planning may not later (e.g., scaling server capacity might shift from build → buy).

---

## ⚖️ **Weighting System**

Used in vendor selection to score proposals fairly:

> Example:
> Technical Capability (40%) + Price (30%) + Delivery (20%) + Past Experience (10%)

---

## 📊 **Independent Cost Estimates**

Used as a “**should-cost**” check to validate vendor quotes — prevents overpricing.

---

## 💸 **Incentives**

Motivators in contracts — early completion, high quality, low defects.

✅ Example: ₹1 lakh bonus if app passes all QA tests in first attempt.

---

## 🧩 **Special Provisions**

---

## 🔍 **Procurement Audit**

Formal review of procurement process for lessons learned, fairness, and compliance.

---

## 🧾 **Formal Acceptance**

Buyer signs off that deliverables meet requirements — triggers final payment and closure.

---

## 🗄️ **Records Management System**

Central repository to store:

* Contracts
* Change requests

---

## 🔒 **Privity**

Legal relationship between parties in a contract — only **buyer and seller** have obligations to each other.

---

## 🏢 **Centralized vs Decentralized Contracting**

| Type              | Description                                      | Pros                   |
