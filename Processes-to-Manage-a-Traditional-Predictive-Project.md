# ⭐ **Processes to Manage a Traditional / Predictive Project**

(Complete With Explanations + Examples + Formulas)

---

# **1. Develop Project Charter**

**Purpose:** Formally authorize the project.

**Output:** Project Charter (high-level scope, schedule, budget, risks, sponsor).

**Example:**
A company approves a “Travel Booking Mobile App”. Charter includes goals, constraints, major stakeholders, budget estimate, etc.

---

# **2. Identify Stakeholders**

List everyone who can impact or be impacted.

**Output:** Stakeholder Register.

**Example:**
Customer, UI/UX team, backend team, marketing, legal, vendor, etc.

---

# **3. Develop Project Management Plan**

The master plan combining all  subsidiary plans.

**Example:**
Schedule plan, cost plan, quality plan, communication plan, risk plan—all integrated.

---

# **4. Plan Scope Management**

Defines how scope will be:

✔ Defined
✔ Validated
✔ Controlled

---

# **5. Collect Requirements**

Gather **functional & non-functional** requirements.

**Tools:** Interviews, surveys, focus groups, prototyping.

**Example:**
Login, signup, OTP, payment gateway, dashboards, reports.

---

# **6. Define Scope**

Convert requirements → clear scope statement.

**Example:**
“Mobile app will support Android and iOS, with online payment and booking history.”

---

# **7. Create WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**

Break deliverables → smaller tasks → work packages.

**Example:**
“Booking Module” → “Search”, “Filter”, “Checkout”, “Payment”.

---

# **8. Plan Schedule Management**

Defines:

* Tools (MS Project, Jira)
* Reporting format
* How schedule will be controlled

---

# **9. Define Activities**

Break WBS work packages → activities.

---

# **10. Sequence Activities**

Use dependencies:

* FS – Finish to Start
* SS – Start to Start
* FF – Finish to Finish
* SF – Start to Finish

**Example:**
"Design UI" must finish before “Start Development”.

---

# **11. Estimate Activity Durations**

Estimate number of days/hours required.

**Methods:** Expert judgment, Analogous, Bottom-up, Three-point.

---

# **12. PERT Formula**

PERT = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6

Example:
O = 3 days
M = 5 days
P = 9 days

PERT = (3 + 20 + 9) / 6 = **5.33 days**

---

# **13. Develop Schedule**

Convert activity durations → a logical schedule using:

* Gantt charts
* Network diagrams
* Critical Path Method

---

# **14. Critical Path Method (CPM) Introduction**

Critical path = **longest duration path** which defines project duration.

If critical tasks delay → project delays.

---

# **15. Critical Path Method (Steps)**

1. List activities
2. Sequence activities
3. Estimate durations
4. Draw network diagram
5. Forward pass → find ES, EF
6. Backward pass → find LS, LF
7. Identify critical path (float = 0)

---

# **16. Calculate Float / Slack**

Float = LS – ES
or
Float = LF – EF

Float > 0 → non-critical
Float = 0 → critical task

---

# **17. Forward Pass**

Calculate:

* Early Start (ES)
* Early Finish (EF = ES + Duration)

---

# **18. Backward Pass**

Calculate:

* Late Finish (LF)
* Late Start (LS = LF – Duration)

---

# **19. Free Float**

Amount of time activity can delay **without delaying the next activity**.

---

# **20. CPM Practice Examples**

(If you want, I can generate 10 solved examples with diagrams.)

---

# **21. Plan Cost Management**

Define how costs will be:

* Estimated
* Budgeted
* Controlled

---

# **22. Estimate Cost**

Estimate individual activity or work package costs.

Methods: Analogous, Bottom-up, Parametric, Three-point.

---

# **23. Determine Budget**

Add all estimated costs → create overall budget.

---

# **24. Plan Quality Management**

Define quality standards + metrics.

**Example:**
App must load in < 3 seconds.

---

# **25. Plan Resource Management**

How to acquire & manage team + equipment.

---

# **26. Estimate Activity Resources**

Estimate number of developers, testers, machines needed.

---

# **27. Plan Communication Management**

Define:

* What to communicate

---

# **28. Plan Risk Management**

Decide how to perform risk identification, analysis, and response.

---

# **29. Identify Risks**

List all risks (technical, schedule, cost, vendor, compliance).

Output: **Risk Register**

---

# **30. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis**

Prioritize risks using:

* Probability
* Impact
* Risk score

---

# **31. Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis**

Use numeric modeling:

* Monte Carlo

* EMV

---

# **32. Plan Risk Response**

Plan strategies:

* Avoid
* Mitigate
* Transfer
