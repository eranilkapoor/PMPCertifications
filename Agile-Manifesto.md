Good question 👍
If you’re preparing from an **Agile Practitioner (PMI-ACP® / Agile mindset)** perspective, the **top priorities** are guided by the **Agile Manifesto** and its **12 principles**.

Here are the **Top Priorities of an Agile Practitioner** (summarized):

---

### 🔑 **1. Customer Satisfaction**

* Highest priority is to **satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery** of valuable software (or product increments).

---

### 🔑 **2. Deliver Value Frequently**

* Deliver working, usable product **early and often** in small increments, not in big-bang releases.

---

### 🔑 **3. Embrace Change**

* Welcome **changing requirements**, even late in development, to give the customer a competitive advantage.

---

### 🔑 **4. Build Collaboration**

* Ensure **business people and developers (or team + stakeholders)** work together daily.
* Promote transparency and frequent feedback.

---

### 🔑 **5. Empower & Support Teams**

* Build projects around **motivated individuals**, give them trust, support, and the environment to succeed.

---

### 🔑 **6. Face-to-Face Communication**

* Value direct, clear communication (nowadays also via virtual collaboration tools).

---

### 🔑 **7. Working Software = Progress**

* The **primary measure of progress** is working product, not documents, reports, or plans.

---

### 🔑 **8. Sustainable Pace**

* Promote a pace of work that is **sustainable indefinitely** (avoid burnout, keep team productive long-term).

---

### 🔑 **9. Technical Excellence**

* Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** improves agility.

---

### 🔑 **10. Simplicity**

* Maximize the amount of work **not done** → focus only on what adds real value.

---

### 🔑 **11. Self-Organizing Teams**

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**, not top-down control.

---

### 🔑 **12. Continuous Improvement**

* At regular intervals (retrospectives), the team reflects on how to become **more effective** and adjusts accordingly.

---

✅ **In short:**
The **top priorities** are: **Customer value, early & frequent delivery, embracing change, collaboration, empowered teams, sustainable pace, technical excellence, simplicity, and continuous improvement.**
