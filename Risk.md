# ⚠️ **Project Risk Management**

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**

To **identify, analyze, and manage potential risks (positive or negative)** that may impact the project’s objectives — scope, schedule, cost, and quality.

* **Risk ≠ Issue**
  → Risk = uncertain event (may or may not happen)
  → Issue = event that *has already happened*

* Goal: *Minimize threats* and *maximize opportunities.*
