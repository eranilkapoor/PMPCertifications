Perfect follow-up 👌 — because **Leads & Lags** often appear with **PDM relationships** in PMP exam questions. Let’s go step by step.

---

# **1. Lead**

👉 Lead is the amount of time **a successor activity can be advanced** (moved earlier) with respect to its predecessor.

In simple terms: **“Start the next activity a bit earlier than usual.”**

### **Example 1 – Software Development**

* Activity A: Coding (Finish)
* Activity B: Testing (Start after coding)
* Normally, Testing starts **after Coding finishes (FS)**.
* But with a **2-day Lead**, Testing can start **2 days before coding is finished** (maybe testers start with modules already completed).

**Effect:** Overlap of tasks → project duration shortens.

# **2. Lag**

👉 Lag is the amount of time **a successor activity is delayed** (moved later) with respect to its predecessor.

In simple terms: **“Add waiting time between activities.”**

### **Example 2 – Construction Project**

* Activity A: Pour concrete (Finish)
* Activity B: Build walls (Start after foundation is ready)
* Concrete needs to **cure for 3 days** before walls can be built.
* So, Activity B has a **3-day Lag** after Activity A.

**Effect:** Waiting period → project duration increases.

# **Quick Summary Table**

| Term     | Meaning                             | Effect on Schedule         | Example                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lead** | Successor starts earlier            | Shortens project duration  | Start testing 2 days before coding finishes           |
| **Lag**  | Successor delayed after predecessor | Increases project duration | Wait 3 days for concrete curing before building walls |

# **Exam-Oriented Trick**

* If you see **overlap / parallel work → Lead**
* If you see **waiting / delay / buffer → Lag**

✅ **Sample PMP Question:**
*You are managing a construction project. The team must wait 5 days after painting before beginning quality inspection. This is an example of:*

* A. Lead
* B. Lag ✅
* C. Fast tracking
* D. Crashing
