In **PMP (Project Management Professional)**, **estimating techniques** are used to predict **time, cost, resources, or effort** required for project activities. These techniques help create realistic schedules and budgets.

---

## 🔑 **1. Analogous Estimating (Top-Down Estimating)**

* **Definition:** Uses historical data from **similar past projects** to estimate current project costs or durations.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Quick and less costly
  * Less accurate (depends on similarity of projects)
* **Example:** “Project X took 6 months, so this similar project will likely take 7 months.”

---

## 🔑 **2. Parametric Estimating**

* **Definition:** Uses **statistical relationships** between historical data and project variables.
* **Characteristics:**

  * More accurate than analogous if data is reliable
  * Uses formulas like: Cost = Unit Cost × Number of Units
* **Example:** Cost per square meter × total area of building = estimated cost

---

## 🔑 **3. Bottom-Up Estimating**

* **Definition:** Estimates **individual work packages or activities** and rolls them up to get the total project estimate.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Most accurate, but time-consuming
  * Requires detailed scope and WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)
* **Example:** Estimating hours for each task in a WBS and summing them up

---

## 🔑 **4. Three-Point Estimating (PERT Technique)**

* **Definition:** Considers **uncertainty** by using three estimates for an activity:

  1. **Optimistic (O)** – Best-case scenario
  2. **Most Likely (M)** – Normal scenario
  3. **Pessimistic (P)** – Worst-case scenario
* **Formula:**

  * **Expected Estimate (E) = (O + 4M + P) / 6**
* **Example:** Task could take 4, 6, or 10 days → E = (4 + 4×6 + 10)/6 = 6.67 days

---

## 🔑 **5. Expert Judgment**

* **Definition:** Relies on knowledge and experience of experts to provide estimates.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Often combined with other techniques
  * Useful for high-level or complex activities

---

## 🔑 **6. Reserve Analysis**

* **Definition:** Adds contingency or management reserves to account for **risk and uncertainty**.
* **Example:** Add 10% buffer for schedule or cost due to uncertainties

### ✅ **Summary Table**

| Technique          | When to Use                           | Accuracy             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Analogous          | Early in project, high-level estimate | Low                  |
| Parametric         | When historical data & formulas exist | Medium-High          |
| Bottom-Up          | When detailed WBS is available        | High                 |
| Three-Point (PERT) | When uncertainty is significant       | Medium-High          |
| Expert Judgment    | Complex or new activities             | Depends on expertise |
| Reserve Analysis   | To account for risk                   | Improves reliability |
