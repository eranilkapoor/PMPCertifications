# **Traditional / Predictive Project Management Overview**

Traditional project management (also called **Waterfall**) is a structured approach where:

✔ Requirements are known early
✔ Work is planned upfront
✔ Phases happen **sequentially**
✔ Change is controlled through formal processes

**Example:**
Building a bridge → requirements, design, materials, safety rules are fixed early → perfect for predictive.

---

# **1. Introduction to Traditional Project Management**

Traditional PM focuses on:

* Detailed upfront planning
* Sequential phases: Requirements → Design → Build → Test → Deploy
* Predictability
* Documentation-heavy
* Strict scope control

**Example:**
Government construction tender → highly regulated → must follow fixed plan.

---

# **2. Introduction to the Process Groups**

PMI organizes all project work into **5 Process Groups** that occur in every phase:

1. **Initiating**
2. **Planning**
3. **Executing**
4. **Monitoring & Controlling**
5. **Closing**

**Example:**
A website development project uses all 5 groups to start, plan, execute, monitor, and close the project.

---

# **3. 49 Processes of Traditional Project Management**

PMBOK 6 (still valid for PMP) defines **49 processes** across 10 knowledge areas, such as:

* Scope Management
* Schedule Management
* Cost Management
* Quality Management
* Resource Management
* Communication
* Risk
* Procurement
* Stakeholder
* Integration

**Example:**
“Define Scope” → planning process
“Control Costs” → monitoring process
“Develop Project Charter” → initiating process

You do not need to memorize the whole list here unless you want it later.

# **4. 5 Process Groups**

These are:

| Process Group                | Purpose         | Example                            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Initiating**               | Approve project | Create project charter             |
| **Planning**                 | Create roadmap  | Build Work Breakdown Structure     |
| **Executing**                | Do the work     | Developers code website            |
| **Monitoring & Controlling** | Track/control   | Compare planned vs actual schedule |
| **Closing**                  | Formal closure  | Final report & sign-off            |

---

# **5. Process ITTOs (Inputs, Tools & Techniques, Outputs)**

Each of the 49 processes has:

* **Inputs** → documents used
* **Tools & Techniques** → methods applied
* **Outputs** → documents/results produced

**Example: Manage Quality Process**

* Input → Quality metrics
* Tool → Statistical sampling
* Output → Quality reports

---

# **6. Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)**

EEFs influence the project from outside.

### **Types**

* Internal (culture, policies, infrastructure)
* External (laws, markets, weather, political climate)

**Example:**
Government cyber-security law requires strict data storage rules → project must follow.

---

# **7. Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**

OPAs are reusable company documents or knowledge.

### **Examples**

* Templates (SOW, WBS, test plan)
* Lessons learned
* Past project files
* Guidelines and checklists

Example:
Your company has a “Project Charter Template” → you reuse it instead of creating from scratch.

---

# **8. Project Documents**

These are **dynamic**, updated throughout the project.

### **Examples**

* Risk Register
* Issue Log
* Stakeholder Register
* Requirements document
* Activity list
* Test logs

Example:
When a new risk is identified → update the **Risk Register**.

---

# **9. Project Management Plan**

The **master plan** combining all subsidiary plans:

* Scope Management Plan
* Schedule Plan
* Cost Plan
* Risk Plan
* Quality Plan
* Communication Plan
* Procurement Plan
* Stakeholder Plan

It guides **how** work will be done.

**Example:**
Project Management Plan says:
“Weekly status meetings every Friday at 4 PM.”

---

# **10. Expert Judgment**

Using experience or specialized knowledge to make decisions.

### **Examples**

* Hiring a cloud architect to guide AWS implementation
* Consulting a senior PM for risk estimation
* Asking legal expert about contract risks

---

# **11. Data Gathering, Analysis, Representation, and Decision Making**

Different steps used for project decisions.

### **Data Gathering Examples**

* Interviews
* Brainstorming
* Surveys
* Checklists

### **Data Analysis Examples**

* SWOT analysis
* Cost-benefit analysis
* Earned Value Analysis

### **Data Representation**

* Flowcharts
* Histograms
* Heat maps
* Gantt charts

### **Decision-Making Techniques**

* Voting
* Multi-criteria decision analysis
* Prioritization

Example:
Team uses **brainstorming** (gathering) + **Pareto chart** (representation) to identify major defect sources.

---

# **12. Interpersonal and Team Skills**

PMs must use soft skills to manage people.

### **Examples**

* Conflict resolution
* Active listening
* Leadership
* Negotiation
* Facilitation
* Emotional intelligence

Example:
Two developers fight over task ownership → PM uses **conflict resolution**.

---

# **13. Meetings**

Meetings are essential for planning, execution, reporting, etc.

### **Types**

* Kickoff meeting
* Daily check-in
* Status meeting
* Lessons learned
* Risk review

Example:
Weekly status meeting tracks progress, issues, and upcoming tasks.

---

# **14. PMIS (Project Management Information System)**

Software tools used to manage the project.

### **Examples**

* MS Project
* Jira
* Trello
* Wrike
* Asana
* Power BI
* Google Workspace
* Confluence

Example:
Jira used for task management and tracking progress.

---

# **15. Change Request**

Any request to modify:

* Scope
* Schedule
* Cost
* Quality
* Resources
* Requirements

### **Types**

* Corrective action
* Preventive action
* Defect repair
* Updates

Example:
Client asks to add one more screen → scope change request → goes through **Change Control Board (CCB)**.

---

# **16. Work Performance Data, Information, and Reports**

These are levels of processed project information.

### **Work Performance Data**

Raw data:

* 5 tasks completed today
* Testing executed for 10 cases

### **Work Performance Information**

Analysis applied:

* Testing progress at 40%
* Development is ahead of schedule

### **Work Performance Reports**

Formatted reports for stakeholders:

* Status reports
* Dashboards
* Heat maps
* Executives summaries

Example:
PM sends a weekly dashboard summarizing all KPIs.

---

# **17. Updates**

During processes, documents or plans get updated.

### **Examples**

* Update risk register
* Update project schedule
* Update requirements
* Update stakeholder engagement plan

Example:
New stakeholder identified → update **Stakeholder Register**.
