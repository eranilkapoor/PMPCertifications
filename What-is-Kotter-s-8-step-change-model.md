## üéÆ **Case Study: GameDev Studio Adopts Agile using Kotter's 8-Step Model**

### üè¢ **Company Background:**

A mid-size game development studio (let‚Äôs call it *PixelForge*) has traditionally followed the Waterfall method. Due to rising competition and frequent changes in player demands, leadership decides to switch to Agile for faster iterations and better collaboration.

---

### üìò **Applying Kotter‚Äôs 8-Step Model:**

---

#### **1. Create a Sense of Urgency**

* **What they did:** Leadership shared data showing that 3 recent projects missed deadlines and had low player engagement due to lack of flexibility.
* **Result:** Team realized that sticking to old methods was a business risk.

---

#### **2. Build a Guiding Coalition**

* **What they did:** Formed a task force of senior developers, product managers, and QA leads to champion Agile.
* **Result:** Created trust and shared ownership of the change.

---

#### **3. Form a Strategic Vision and Initiatives**

* **What they did:** Defined a clear vision: *‚ÄúDeliver better games, faster, with stronger teamwork‚Äù*. Introduced 2 pilot teams using Scrum.
* **Result:** Everyone knew what Agile meant and how it would be rolled out.

---

#### **4. Enlist a Volunteer Army**

* **What they did:** Held town halls, demo sessions, and Q\&A meetings to inspire early adopters.
* **Result:** Enthusiastic junior devs, testers, and designers volunteered to join the pilot.

---

#### **5. Enable Action by Removing Barriers**

* **What they did:** Replaced outdated task management software with Jira, offered Scrum training, and adjusted rigid reporting structures.
* **Result:** Teams felt empowered to make decisions and experiment.

---

#### **6. Generate Short-Term Wins**

* **What they did:** In 6 weeks, the pilot team delivered a new game feature that increased player engagement by 20%.
* **Result:** Publicly celebrated in team meetings‚Äîboosted morale and confidence.

---

#### **7. Sustain Acceleration**

* **What they did:** Expanded Agile practices across all teams. Hired an Agile coach. Began monthly retrospectives to track improvements.
* **Result:** Agile culture began to spread organically.

---

#### **8. Institute Change**

* **What they did:** Updated onboarding materials to include Agile principles. Leadership tied promotions to team-based success and innovation.
* **Result:** Agile became ‚Äúthe way things are done‚Äù at PixelForge.

---

### üéØ **Outcome:**

* 30% faster release cycles
* Higher employee satisfaction
* More positive user feedback on game updates
