Great question üëç PMP has a clear section on **Resource Optimization Techniques** ‚Äî you‚Äôll definitely see this in exam questions under **Schedule Management** & **Resource Management**.

# **Resource Optimization Techniques**

These are techniques used to **balance demand and availability of resources** (people, equipment, materials).
Two key methods are:

---

## **1. Resource Leveling**

üëâ Purpose: **Resolve over-allocation / conflicts** of resources.

* Adjusts **start and finish dates** based on resource constraints.
* Often changes the **critical path**.
* May **increase project duration**.

**Example:**

* Task A and Task B both need the same engineer.
* Both are scheduled in Week 1.
* Since the engineer can only do one task at a time, Task B is delayed to Week 2.
* Result ‚Üí Project duration may increase.

**When used:**

* Resources are limited.
* To prevent burnout/overallocation.
* To ensure realistic resource assignment.

---

## **2. Resource Smoothing**

üëâ Purpose: **Optimize resources without affecting project‚Äôs critical path or end date**.

* Adjusts activities **within their float/slack**.
* Does **not change the critical path**.
* May leave some resource demand unbalanced.

**Example:**

* Task A has **5 days float**.
* If resource demand is too high in Week 1, Task A can be shifted to Week 2 (using float).
* Project finish date stays the same.

**When used:**

* To optimize resource utilization.
* When the **end date is fixed**.

## **Key Differences: Resource Leveling vs Resource Smoothing**

| Aspect                     | **Resource Leveling**          | **Resource Smoothing**          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Effect on Critical Path    | May change critical path       | Does not change critical path   |
| Effect on Project Duration | May increase                   | No increase (finish date fixed) |
| Flexibility                | Resolves over-allocation fully | Optimizes within float          |
| Priority                   | Resource availability          | Project deadline                |

# **Exam Tip**

* If question says **‚Äúresources are limited/over-allocated‚Äù** ‚Üí **Resource Leveling**.
* If question says **‚Äúdeadline can‚Äôt change‚Äù** but resources need balancing ‚Üí **Resource Smoothing**.

---

‚úÖ **Quick Mnemonic:**

* **Leveling = Longer project** (critical path can change).
* **Smoothing = Same project duration** (use float to optimize).
