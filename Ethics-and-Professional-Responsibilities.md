# **Ethics and Professional Responsibilities (PMP Context)**

PMP expects project managers to follow the **PMI Code of Ethics & Professional Conduct**, which is based on **four core values: Responsibility, Respect, Fairness, and Honesty**.

Let’s explain each section from your list.

---

# **1. Professional Responsibilities and Ethics**

This refers to how project managers must behave professionally:

### **Key Principles**

* Act with **integrity and honesty**.
* Maintain **confidentiality**.
* Treat everyone with **respect**.
* Avoid conflicts of interest.
* Follow **laws, regulations, and organizational policies**.
* Report unethical or illegal behavior.

### **Example**

If a project manager discovers the vendor is inflating bills, they must report it—not ignore it to keep the peace.

---

# **2. Truth**

Truthfulness means being **honest, transparent, and accurate** in all project communications.

### **What it includes**

* No false reporting to make project status look better.
* No hiding issues from stakeholders.
* No manipulating data.

### **Example**

If your sprint velocity dropped because developers were sick, you must report the **real reason**, not blame “technical error.”

---

# **3. Laws**

Project managers must:

* Follow **local, national, and international laws**.
* Respect **industry regulations** (e.g., GDPR, environmental laws, safety standards).
* Ensure contracts and procurement comply with legal frameworks.

### **Example**

A software project handling EU customers must comply with **GDPR** for data protection.

---

# **4. Gifts and Donations**

This refers to handling gifts, rewards, or favors ethically.

### **Guideline**

* Accepting gifts **that influence decision-making** is unethical.
* Modest, symbolic gifts may be acceptable if allowed by company policy.

### **Examples**

✔ Acceptable: A promotional pen from the vendor.
✘ Not acceptable: Vendor giving you an expensive phone before contract signing.

This prevents **bribery** and **conflict of interest**.

---

# **5. Permission**

This refers to gaining appropriate authorization before:

* Sharing confidential information
* Making commitments
* Accessing restricted systems
* Using project resources
* Changing project scope or schedule

### **Example**

You cannot share customer requirements documents with an external consultant unless the client approves it.

# **6. PMI (Project Management Institute)**

PMI’s ethical guidelines include:

### **The Four Core Values**

1. **Responsibility** — take ownership of decisions and actions.
2. **Respect** — listen, value diversity, avoid harassment.
3. **Fairness** — be objective, avoid favoritism.
4. **Honesty** — be truthful and transparent.

### **What PMI expects from PMs**

* Follow the **PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct**.
* Report unethical behavior.
* Maintain professionalism even under pressure.
* Avoid conflicts of interest.
* Maintain competency—continuous learning and certification ethics.

### **PMI Discipline Cases Example**

* Copying exam questions = violation.
* Falsifying project experience to qualify for PMP = violation.
