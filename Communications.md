## 1️⃣ **Plan Communications Management**

### **Goal:**

To create a **Communication Management Plan** that defines *who needs what information, when, how, and by whom it will be delivered.*

---

### **Key Inputs:**

* Project Charter
* Stakeholder Register
* Project Management Plan (esp. Resource & Stakeholder Plans)
* Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)
* Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)

---

### **Tools & Techniques:**

1. **Communication Requirements Analysis**

   * Determines the *information needs* of stakeholders.
   * Helps avoid both *information overload* and *lack of communication*.

   📘 Formula for possible communication channels:
   [
   \text{Number of Channels} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   ]
   Where **n = number of stakeholders**.
   (Example: 5 stakeholders → 10 communication channels)

2. **Communication Technology**

   * Medium used: Email, meetings, chat tools, video conferences, reports, dashboards, etc.
   * Selection based on project size, urgency, complexity, and confidentiality.

3. **Communication Models**

   * **Basic Model:** Sender → Message → Receiver (with feedback loop)
   * **Noise** = Anything that distorts the message (e.g., language barriers, technical issues)

4. **Communication Methods**

   * **Interactive:** Meetings, calls, chats — real-time, two-way.
   * **Push:** Sent directly (emails, memos, reports) — sender ensures delivery.
   * **Pull:** Stakeholders access when needed (intranet, dashboards).

5. **Meetings & Expert Judgment**

---

### **Outputs:**

* **Communications Management Plan**

  * Includes: stakeholder needs, communication methods, frequency, responsibilities, and escalation process.
* Updates to project documents (stakeholder register, schedule, etc.)

---

## 2️⃣ **Manage Communications**

### **Goal:**

Ensure timely collection, creation, distribution, and storage of information.

This is the *execution* part — actually **performing communications** based on the plan.

---

### **Key Inputs:**

* Communications Management Plan
* Work Performance Reports
* Enterprise/Organizational factors

---

### **Tools & Techniques:**

* **Communication Technology** (email, dashboards, instant messaging)
* **Project Reporting** (status reports, progress dashboards)
* **Interpersonal and Team Skills**

  * Active listening
  * Conflict resolution
  * Cultural awareness
  * Feedback and persuasion
* **Meetings** (stand-ups, reviews, demos, etc.)

---

### **Outputs:**

* **Project Communications** (the actual deliverables — reports, minutes, presentations, etc.)
* Updates to project documents and plans
* **Change requests** (if communication issues affect the project)

---

## 3️⃣ **Monitor Communications**

### **Goal:**

Assess whether communication is effective and if stakeholders are receiving and understanding information as intended.

---

### **Key Inputs:**

* Project Communications
* Issue Log
* Stakeholder Engagement Plan

---

### **Tools & Techniques:**

* **Expert Judgment**
* **Project Management Information System (PMIS)**
* **Meetings**
* **Interpersonal & Team Skills**

  * Observation
  * Feedback
  * Active listening

---

### **Outputs:**

* **Work Performance Information**

  * (e.g., Are reports being read? Are issues understood?)
* **Change Requests**

  * (e.g., Adjust frequency or method of communication)
* **Updates to Communication/Stakeholder Management Plans**

## 💡 **Key Concepts & Exam Points**

| Concept                           | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sender–Receiver Model**         | Involves encoding, transmitting, decoding, and feedback. “Noise” can interfere. |
| **Communication Channel Formula** | ( n(n-1)/2 ) → used to show complexity increases with team size.                |
| **Communication Methods**         | Push, Pull, and Interactive — know examples of each.                            |
| **Effective Communication**       | Focused on clarity, understanding, and feedback.                                |
| **Feedback Loop**                 | Ensures the message is received and understood as intended.                     |
| **PM Role**                       | 90% of a PM’s time is spent communicating!                                      |
