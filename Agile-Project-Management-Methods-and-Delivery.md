# 📌 **1. What is Agile?**

Agile is a **value-driven**, **iterative**, and **incremental** approach to project delivery that focuses on:

* Customer collaboration
* Fast delivery of value
* Adapting to change
* Self-organizing teams

### 📝 Example

A mobile app team releases a small “Login + Home UI” in week 1, then adds features every 2 weeks based on user feedback.

---

# 📌 **2. Agile vs Traditional Project Management (Waterfall)**

| Area         | Agile                  | Traditional (Waterfall) |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Requirements | Evolving, flexible     | Fixed at start          |
| Delivery     | Incremental            | One final delivery      |
| Change       | Welcome change         | Change control required |
| Customer     | Continuous involvement | Limited involvement     |
| Planning     | Adaptive               | Predictive              |
| Team         | Self-organizing        | Command & control       |

### 📝 Example

Waterfall: Build full e-commerce site and deliver after 4 months.
Agile: Deliver login → product listing → cart → checkout every 2 weeks.

---

# 📌 **3. Agile Benefits**

* Early value delivery
* Better risk management
* Faster ROI
* High customer satisfaction
* Continuous improvement
* Reduced wastage
* Improved transparency

---

# 📌 **4. Inverting the Triangle**

Traditional PM:
📌 **Scope is fixed** → Time & Cost vary.

Agile:
📌 **Time & Cost are fixed** → Scope varies.

### 📝 Example

Sprint = 2 weeks (fixed).
Budget = Fixed.
Scope delivered = Flexible (highest priority first).

---

# 📌 **5. Agile Manifesto**

Created in 2001 — foundation of Agile.

---

# 📌 **6. Agile Manifesto Values**

Four core values:

### 1️⃣ **Individuals & interactions** over processes & tools

### 2️⃣ **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

### 3️⃣ **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

### 4️⃣ **Responding to change** over following a plan

---

# 📌 **7. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**

People solve problems, not tools.

### Example

A developer directly talks to QA to fix a bug instead of updating 5 Jira fields.

---

# 📌 **8. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**

Deliver functionality, not documents.

### Example

A user can log in and see the dashboard — that matters more than a 50-page SRS.

---

# 📌 **9. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**

Customer gives frequent feedback instead of waiting until the end.

### Example

Client suggests UI changes after Sprint Review — team adapts immediately.

---

# 📌 **10. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**

Change is welcomed, not avoided.

### Example

A new payment gateway is required mid-project → add to next sprint.

---
