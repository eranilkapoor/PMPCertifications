## 🌟 What are **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)?**

**OKRs** are a **goal-setting framework** used by organizations, teams, and individuals to align efforts and measure progress toward achieving ambitious outcomes.

They help answer 2 questions:

1. **Objective** → *What do we want to achieve?* (the *direction*)
2. **Key Results** → *How will we measure success?* (the *metrics*)

## 🏆 Structure of OKRs

* **Objective (O):**

  * A qualitative, inspirational, ambitious goal.
  * Example: *“Improve customer satisfaction on our travel booking platform.”*

* **Key Results (KRs):**

  * 3–5 measurable outcomes that show progress toward the objective.
  * Example:

    * Increase Net Promoter Score (NPS) from 45 to 70.
    * Reduce average customer support response time from 12 hours to 2 hours.
    * Achieve a 25% increase in repeat bookings.
