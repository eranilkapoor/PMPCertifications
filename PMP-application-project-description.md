**PMP application project description** is very important because PMI uses it to verify that you have real project management experience across the five **Process Groups** (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing).

---

## 📌 Project Description Format (Recommended by PMI)

Your description should:

1. Be **200–500 words** (max 550 characters in the PMI form).
2. Clearly show your role as a **project manager or leader** (not just a team member).
3. Cover activities across **all 5 process groups**.
4. Use **concise, action-oriented sentences**.

👉 Suggested Format (STAR-like, but aligned to PMI):

* **Initiating:** State business need, define objectives, identify stakeholders.
* **Planning:** Describe scope, schedule, budget, risk, communications, resources.
* **Executing:** Direct and manage the work, engage stakeholders, lead team.
* **Monitoring/Controlling:** Track progress, manage changes, report performance.
* **Closing:** Obtain acceptance, close contracts, capture lessons learned.

## ✅ Example PMP Project Description

**“Led a software development project to build an online travel booking platform. During Initiating, I worked with stakeholders to define business requirements, high-level scope, and secured project charter approval. In Planning, I developed the WBS, project schedule, budget, risk register, and communication plan. In Executing, I coordinated development, testing, and stakeholder engagement, ensuring deliverables met quality standards. During Monitoring & Controlling, I tracked progress against the baseline, managed scope changes, and reported status to leadership. In Closing, I obtained formal client acceptance, transitioned deliverables to operations, and documented lessons learned.”**

⚡ Tips:

* Always write in **first-person active voice** (“I led…”, “I developed…”).
* Emphasize your **leadership & management**, not technical work.
* Avoid jargon—keep it simple, PMI reviewers are generalists.
* Each project description must clearly show **coverage of all 5 process groups**.
